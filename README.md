# To-study-and-implement-Operators-in-C-

Aim: The aim is to study and implement various operators in C++, including arithmetic, relational, and logical operators, to understand their usage and impact on data manipulation and decision making.

Procedure:

  1) Write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of arithmetic operators like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).

  2) Take two integer inputs from the user using cin.

  3) Perform arithmetic operations and display the results using cout.

  4) Implement relational operators such as equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).

  5) Compare the input values using relational operators and display the boolean results.

  6) Demonstrate the use of logical operators (&&, ||, !) in combining relational expressions.

  7) Compile and run the program to verify all outputs.

Conclusion: This experiment provided a thorough understanding of how arithmetic, relational, and logical operators function in C++. It demonstrated the importance of these operators in performing calculations and making decisions based on conditions in a program.
