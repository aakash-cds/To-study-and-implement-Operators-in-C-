# ðŸ’¡ Experiment 3: Operators in C++

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To study and implement **arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators** in C++.

---

## ðŸ“š Theory

Operators in C++ are special symbols that perform specific operations on variables and values. They are fundamental for all kinds of computations and decision-making in C++ programs.

### ðŸ‘‰ Types of Operators:
1. **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
2. **Relational Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
3. **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`
4. **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`  

These operators are used to perform operations between operands like integers, floats, etc.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Performing calculations using operators
- Using `cout` for displaying results
- Understanding precedence of different operators

---

## ðŸ§ª Procedure
1. Open your C++ IDE or editor.
2. Include the basic headers:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   ```
3. Declare variables and perform operations using the above operators.
4. Print the results using `cout`.
5. Compile and run the program to verify the output.

---

## âœ… Sample Output
Displays the result of various arithmetic and logical expressions clearly on screen.

---

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Outcomes
- Understood different types of operators in C++
- Implemented operators through a simple program
- Gained confidence in using operators in real-world logic
